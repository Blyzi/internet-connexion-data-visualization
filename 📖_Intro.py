In this analysis, we are looking into a dataset of the internet connection speed in France by commune and region. 
The dataset is available on the [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/ma-connexion-internet/) website.
Ma connexion internet, an innovative project developed by Arcep(AutoritÃ© de rÃ©gulation des communications Ã©lectroniques, des postes et de la distribution de la presse), is a data source that lets people find out which Internet access technologies are available at their address, and keep them better informed about fiber rollouts. This open data brings together the site's data in an accessible, reusable format.
The dataset is updated every trimester without any missing value and for this visualisation, we are looking at the data from 2020 to 2023.

The dataset contains the following information:
"""

st.table(pd.DataFrame.from_dict(columns_description,
         orient='index', columns=['Description']))

"""
Before going further, you have to know some facts about the internet technology used in France and the internet speed associated with it.
"""
st.table(techno_description)

"""
Here is what the dataset looks like:
"""

st.dataframe(df.drop('geometry', axis=1))
