In this analysis, we are looking into a dataset of the internet connection speed in France by commune and region. 
The dataset is available on the [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/ma-connexion-internet/) website.
The dataset is updated every trimester without any missing value and for this visualisation, we are looking at the data from 2020 to 2023.

The dataset contains the following information:
"""

st.table(pd.DataFrame.from_dict(columns_description,
         orient='index', columns=['Description']))

"""
Before going further, you have to know some fact about the internet technology used in France and the debit associated with it.

Here is what the dataset looks like:
"""

st.dataframe(df.drop('geometry', axis=1))
