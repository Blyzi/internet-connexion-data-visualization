In this analysis, I have looked into a dataset of the internet connection speed in France by commune and region and done many visualisations at different scales. I have used many libraries such as:
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web app
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for plotting
- [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) for interactive maps
- [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) for geospatial data manipulation
- [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for interactive plots
- [Pydeck](https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for 3D plots
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for interactive plots
- [Millify](https://pypi.org/project/millify/) for formatting numbers
- [Missingno](https://pypi.org/project/missingno/) for missing values visualisation (not used in the final version)

It was a very interesting project but I have to admit that I have spent a lot of time on it and it was dificult to work with a dataset with few links between the different columns. I have learned a lot of things about data visualisation and I am very happy with the result. I hope you enjoyed it too.
